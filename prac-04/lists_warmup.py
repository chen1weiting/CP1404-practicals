numbers[0] - 3 (returns the first item in the list)

numbers[-1] - 2 (returns the last item in the list)

numbers[3] - 1 (returns the fourth item in the list)

numbers[:-1] - [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9] (returns all of the items in the list up to the last item)

numbers[3:4] - [1] (returns the fourth item in the list)

5 in numbers - True (returns a boolean value which determines if 5 is in the list)

7 in numbers - False (returns a boolean value which determines if 7 is in the list)

"3" in numbers - False (returns a boolean value which determines if the string "3" is in the list)

numbers + [6, 5, 3] - [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3] (returns the list with the additional items added to the end)

 

1. numbers[0] = "ten" 

2. numbers[-1] = 1 

3. print(numbers[2:])

4. Yes, 9 is an element of numbers because it is an integer value that is included in the list. We can verify this by printing out the list and seeing that 9 is included: print(numbers) [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
